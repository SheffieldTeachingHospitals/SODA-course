      <div class="col-md-7">
        <p>The SODA course was created in response to a higher than average incidence of failed obstetric intubation of 1 in 119, at our tertiary obstetric centre, compared to the national average of 1 in 224. Based on the review of 10 failed obstetric intubation cases from January 2009 to July 2013, common trends that were identified was the anaesthetic trainee as primary anaesthetist, working with distant Consultant supervision, out of hours, raised body mass index (BMI) and mallapati score greater than 1. Fortunately, there was no maternal or fetal morbidity or mortality.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, it was vital to address this clinical concern. A multi-facet approach was taken to reduce the incidence of failed obstetric intubations at our tertiary centre.</p>
        <p>Education and training is at the heart of this approach and thus, the SODA course was created and delivered in 2014. The production of the HAPPE pre-induction checklist and application for funding of a high fidelity obstetric manikin (NOELLE) were also part of the multifacet approach, of which both feature on the SODA course.</p>
        <p>A repeat service review in 2015 has shown a reduced incidence of failed intubation at our centre to 1 in 375.</p>
        <p>The SODA course continues to educate and equip candidates with strategies and advance airway skills and promotes multi-disciplinary team working in an emergency setting.</p>

        <h3>SODA Publications</h3>
